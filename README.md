# HOW TO PLAY

Given a 10-letter word, create as many words as possible. Letters can be repeated, however duplicate or invalid entries (not found in the English dictionary) do not count. 
Points are allocated based on complexity (i.e. length). See below for the scoring system: 

| Word Length   | Point Value |
| ------------- |-------------|
|      1-3      |       2     |
|      4-5      |       4     |
|      6-9      |       6     |
|      10+      |       10    |

Scores are updated live with a timer counting down. At the end of the game, the player can play subsequent games by clicking 'play again'.
